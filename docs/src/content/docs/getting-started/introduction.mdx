# lspls

**lspls** (**L**SP **P**rotocol **L**anguage **S**ervices) generates Go structs, interfaces, and constants directly from the official [Language Server Protocol specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/).

## The Problem

The LSP specification is defined in TypeScript and published as `metaModel.json`. Many Go LSP implementations need these types, but existing options are limited:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="go.lsp.dev/protocol" icon="warning">
    Stuck on LSP 3.15.3 since 2020. Missing modern features like InlayHints.
  </Card>
  <Card title="gopls internal types" icon="warning">
    Up-to-date but in `internal/` package - cannot be imported.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## The Solution

**lspls** generates types directly from the official specification:

- Always up-to-date with the latest LSP version
- Generate all types or only what you need
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Clean, idiomatic Go code

## How It Works

1. **Fetches** `metaModel.json` from [microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node)
2. **Parses** the JSON specification into a typed model
3. **Generates** Go code with proper type mappings:
   - TypeScript interfaces to Go structs
   - TypeScript unions (`A | B`) to union types with JSON marshaling
   - TypeScript `T | null` to Go `*T` with `omitempty`
   - Enumerations to Go `const` with typed values

## Next Steps

- [Installation](/lspls/getting-started/installation/) - Install lspls
- [Quick Start](/lspls/getting-started/quick-start/) - Generate your first types
- [CLI Reference](/lspls/reference/cli/) - All available options
