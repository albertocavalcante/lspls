## Quick Example

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/albertocavalcante/lspls/cmd/lspls@latest

# Generate all LSP types
lspls -o ./protocol/

# Generate specific types only
lspls -t InlayHint,Position,Range -o ./types.go

# Preview without writing
lspls --dry-run
```

## Why lspls?

The LSP specification is published as `metaModel.json` but most Go LSP libraries are outdated:

- **go.lsp.dev/protocol** is stuck on LSP 3.15.3
- **gopls** has up-to-date types but they're in `internal/` and can't be imported

**lspls** solves this by generating types directly from the official specification - always current, fully customizable.
